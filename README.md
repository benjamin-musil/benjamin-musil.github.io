## Statement of Purpose and Goals
In the short-term, I am seeking a software developer position in web with opportunities within an Agile-like environment.

My long-term is to become a software architect or be involved with planning the layout and structure of a whole application or platform. I would enjoy figuring out a structure that works with several different technologies as well as sharing that vision with a small team and collaborating with experienced developers who can help me figure out how several pieces of a platform can mesh together well for the current situation as well as future growth. I've experienced architectures that really failed to plan for future expansion and it becomes a huge mess quickly. I would like to prevent that so others don't have to share that frustration.

## Projects

### [Line Picker](https://github.com/benjamin-musil/line-picker-webapp)
*Mobile and Web App - React Native, Android SDK, MongoDB, Flask, Firebase*

Uses crowdsourced data to find out wait times of nearby restaurants based on category of food, distance to user, favorite category set by user, and other similar criteria. Users can submit wait times for specific restaurants with a picture to show the activity of the restaurant. Users also have the ability to add restaurants and check previous post history.

I worked with three other developers on this multi-platform app. Flask supported the app's back-end. The Android app front-end was written natively using Android SDK and refactored to include iOS compatibility with React Native. 

I wrote the interactions and links between Flask and MongoDB for data storage and filtering data. I used the Google Maps API for location services and Android/iOS camera APIs for capturing images and storing those images to local storage.

### [IsThereAnyDeal Finder](https://github.com/adamdavies001/isthereanydeal-lookup)
*Discord Bot - Node.js*

 Looks up active deals for PC games through the [IsThereAnyDeal](IsThereAnyDeal.com) API when the bot is pinged in a Discord server. Users can add sellers to ignore. A feature for a server-curated wishlist and automated notifications is in progress. I am actively developing this with another person. This was originally a bot for our own private server, but we are making it so that it can be used by the public. Potential for income through affiliate links, however we'd have to create our own web scraper or interact with other API tools per the agreement with IsThereAnyDeal's API usage.

I am writing the server-curated wishlist portion of the bot. I have refactored code to use an API endpoint once instead of multiple times. I updated the response to be able to return multiple games as well as give more info such as a cover image of the game and user reviews if they are available.

### Boardgame Deals and Hub
*Web App - MERN stack*

Taking inspiration from [DekuDeals](DekuDeals.com), I want to make a modern price tracker for board games while providing tools for library management. [Boardgamegeek](Boardgamegeek.com) is a popular site for board game stats but I feel it's lacking when it comes to finding games on sale and the design is a bit noisy for my taste. Other sites also track board game prices, but I would like present data such as a user score, send notifications to users, and generate recommendations for each user. I also want to bridge the gap between physical and digital players, especially with the current times of social distancing, which means tracking standalone digital games and DLC for platforms such as Tabletop Simulator.

This project is still in the beginning stages I currently have a framework setup and I'm working on a front-end mock-up. I will likely port some code for the digital tracking from the IsThereAnyDeal bot above.

Planning to monetize through affiliate links so the repo is private at this moment. Will post screenshots when as the project progresses.

## Skills
In addition to the technologies mentioned above, I also have experience in:  
- OOP Languages: Python, C++, Java/Kotlin
- Tools: JIRA, GitHub, GitLab

## Personal Life and Interests
Hey, I'm not a developer 100% of the time either! I love my fair share of leisurely activity and spending time with family, friends, and strangers. If I didn't have to work, I would love to host and lead guided tours for parks around the country and even the world. There are so many national, state, and local parks across the country and not enough people take time away from being "plugged-in" to find peace of mind in nature! My favorite parks I have visited are the Yosemite, Big Bend, and Rocky Mountain National Parks.

I enjoy reading all types of books and discussing philosophy and theology. My favorite fictional series is Lord of the Rings (I can't tell you how awesome the audiobooks are) and I often have a rotation of 4 or 5 fiction and non-fiction books. Come share a local craft beer with me and we can talk about all sorts of books and movies!

Speaking of movies, I'm a Nicolas Cage afficiando and I even hosted a Nic Cage Friday weekly event in my freshman dorm in college. My favorite Cage movie is Face/Off because you get both a good movie and an insane Nicolas Cage. Travolta is a bonus because he is basically a Nicolas Cage clone in that movie.
