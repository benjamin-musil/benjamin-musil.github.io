## Ben Musil - Experience and Bio
Thank you for stopping by! My name is Ben and I am married and father to three children. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas and currently reside there after a brief stint in Montana! I graduated from Texas A&M with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I also took a few graduate-level courses in Software Engineering at the University of Texas. I am currently a front-end software engineer working remotely full-time. I have steered my career to software engineering through further education, taking on more responsibilities at work, and pursuing personal projects to practice those skills.

## Personal Life and Interests
Hey, I'm not a developer 100% of the time either! I love my fair share of leisurely activity and spending time with family, friends, and strangers. If I didn't have to work, I would love to host and lead guided tours for parks around the country and even the world. There are so many national, state, and local parks across the country and not enough people take time away from being "plugged-in" to find peace of mind in nature! My favorite parks I have visited are the Yosemite, Big Bend, and Rocky Mountain National Parks. Other outdoor activities I enjoy are basketball, tennis, and running.

Aside from that, I am the barista dad at home. I started my coffee journey with really awful big-batch coffee at a job but I evolved through grinding my own beans for custom Keurig cups, using a french press, and finally graduated to the beloved espresso machine. My normal go-to is an Americano.

With that caffeine, I enjoy reading all types of books and discussing philosophy and theology. I am Catholic and I welcome respectful dialog with people of other viewpoints and I enjoy meaningful engagement with people of all walks of life. My favorite fictional series is Lord of the Rings (I can't tell you how awesome the audiobooks are by Rob Inglis) and I often have a rotation of 4 or 5 fictional and non-fictional books. Come share a local craft beer with me and we can talk about all sorts of books and movies!

Speaking of movies, I'm a Nicolas Cage afficiando and I even hosted a Nic Cage Friday weekly event in my freshman dorm in college. My favorite Cage movie is Face/Off because you get both a good movie and an insane Nicolas Cage. Travolta is a bonus because he is basically a Nicolas Cage clone in that movie.

I'm also a gamer at heart, both board games and video games. I have a large bookshelf dedicated to games such as Catan, Dominion, Carcassonne, King of Tokyo, Elder Sign, and many others. For video games, I'm primarily on PC but I play just about anything from retro or modern, indie or AAA. With older games I love finding community support such as the [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/) project for Chris Sawyer's Roller Coaster Tycoon. I've even hosted game servers for 7 Days to Die and Roller Coaster Tycoon using my 2012 Thinkpad (which I still use time to time).
