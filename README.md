## Statement of Purpose and Goals
In the short-term, I am seeking a software developer position in web with opportunities within an Agile-like environment. My long-term is to become a software architect or be involved with planning the layout and structure of a whole application or platform. I would enjoy figuring out a structure that works with several different technologies as well as sharing that vision with a small team and collaborating with experienced developers who can help me figure out how several pieces of a platform can mesh together well for the current situation as well as future growth. I've experienced architectures that really failed to plan for future expansion and it becomes a huge mess quickly. I would like to prevent that so others don't have to share that frustration.

Taking inspiration from DekuDeals.com, I want to make a modern price tracker for board games while providing tools for library management. Boardgamegeek.com is a popular site for board game stats but I feel it's lacking when it comes to finding games on sale and the design is a bit noisy for my taste. Other sites also track board game prices, but I would like present data such as a user score, send notifications to users, and generate recommendations for each user. I also want to bridge the gap between physical and digital players, especially with the current times of social distancing, which means tracking standalone digital games and DLC for platforms such as Tabletop Simulator.

This project is still in progress, currently a framework is setup .

## Skills
In addition to the technologies mentioned above, I also have experience in:  
- OOP Languages: Python, C++, Java/Kotlin
- Tools: JIRA, GitHub, GitLab
